# WebdriverIO API Docs

Welcome to the WebdriverIO docs page. These pages contain reference materials for all implemented selenium bindings and commands. WebdriverIO has all [JSONWire protocol](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol) commands implemented and also supports special bindings for [Appium](http://appium.io).

Each command documentation usually comes with an example that demonstrates the usage of it using WebdriverIO asynchronously in standalone mode and synchronously using the wdio test runner. If an asynchronous or synchronous example is missing that __doesn't__ mean that this command can't be used in one of both modes, it just doesn't need an additional example to demonstrate it usage. All commands are usable synchronously with the wdio testrunner as well as asynchronously in standalone mode.

If you feel like you have a good example for a command, don't hesitate to open a PR and submit it. Just click on the orange button on the top right with the label _"Improve this doc"_. Make sure you understand the way we write these docs by checking the [Contribute](/contribute.html) section.
