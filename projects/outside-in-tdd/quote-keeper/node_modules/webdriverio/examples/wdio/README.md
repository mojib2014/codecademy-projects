# WDIO

This directory contains config files for each framework for the wdio test runner. It also shows you how to run multiremote test with the test runner as well as WebdriverCSS tests. To execute the framework configs you need the desired framework installed locally. Then just run the wdio executable from the root directory of the WebdriverIO repository:

```sh
./bin/wdio examples/wdio/wdio.mocha.conf.js
```
